## Instructions:
### Card Values
- Numbered Cards: Face value.
- Face cards (J, Q, K): 10 points.

### Gameplay
- Each player, including the dealer, gets two cards.

 ### Winning Conditions:
 - Be closer to 21 than the dealer to win.
 - If the dealer busts, all remaining players win.
 - A tie is a 'push,' and the bet is returned.

### Blackjack (Natural 21):
- Achieved with an Ace and a 10-value card.
- The player wins unless the dealer also has Blackjack.

### Options: 
- Variations: 'Double Down,' 'Split,' 'Insurance.
- 'Double Down': Double your bet and commit to stand after receiving one more card.
- 'Split': If you have two cards of the same value, you can split them into two separate hands.
- 'Insurance': A side bet that the dealer has Blackjack when showing an Ace.

### Remember:
- There's an element of chance, but strategy is important.
- Enjoy the game and have fun!
